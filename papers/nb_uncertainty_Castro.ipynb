    "The paper is on treating features as distributions.  It uses Gaussian Processes (GP) to treat the time series like a distribution, making use of both the measurement error given in the data, $\\epsilon$, and the error associated with gaps in the time series.  The paper also covers sampling from the distributions and training a random forest based on the samples (randomness in the data from the sampling, not the feature selection)."
